    <h1>Calamari in a Creamy White Sauce</h1>
    <img src="../images/calamari.jpg" alt="A great food for main dish" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
    <h3>This dish looks like you slaved over it and has such a rich taste that you don't need any sides. 
    It is a creamy spicy calamari in white wine sauce over pasta. 
    Dinner for two but easily doubled. Serve with the rest of the wine!</h3>
    <p>What Does Calamari Taste Like? Calamari meat is firm and sometimes chewy (it should never be rubbery, however). The taste itself is mild and slightly sweet. 
    Calamari's flavor is somewhat hard to pin down, as the tender meat readily absorbs spices it's marinated in.</p>
