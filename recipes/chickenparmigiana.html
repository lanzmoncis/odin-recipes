    <h3>I received this recipe several years ago from a family member who swore it was a great romantic meal.
     She was right. My husband asks me to make this meal every time we have a date night. The quantity of ingredients look intimidating,
     but don't let them fool you. It's easy and delicious! The whipping cream gives it a creamy texture that you just can't get enough of!</h3>
     <p>Brace yourself for this one—they're the same dish! Chicken Parmesan and chicken Parmigiana are just different names for the same exact recipe.
     And, with a name like “chicken Parmigiana”, you might assume that this recipe is Italian. While it has roots in Italy (in a way),
     chicken Parmesan is all-American.</p>

             <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
             <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
             <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
             <li>3 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
             <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>

         <h4>Directions</h4>
         <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in garlic and onion, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent,
             about 2 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes and sugar. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low,
             and continue simmering for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the sauce has simmered, stir in the cream and season to taste with salt and pepper.
             Simmer for an additional 3 minutes. Lower heat and keep sauce warm</li>
             <li>Stir together bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, and dried oregano; set aside. In a small bowl, whisk together egg and 2 tablespoons milk until blended.
             Dip chicken breasts into the egg, then press into breadcrumb mixture to coat both sides, shaking off excess.</li>
             <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken breasts and cook on both sides until they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C),
             and the bread crumb crust is golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
             <li>To serve, spoon sauce over chicken and top with Mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. Let stand a few minutes until the cheese has melted from the heat of the sauce.</li>
